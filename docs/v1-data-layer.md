# V1 local data and business layer

Scope confirmed by Suvo on 2026-10-07: the complete local data layer for the manual-first MVP (#8–#15). Rohan owns custom screens. There is no hosted backend, app account, network prerequisite, analytics or automatic message access. Automatic Android/iOS capture, receipt OCR, connected email, forecasts and encrypted backup/restore remain separate work.

## Screen contract

Call `await getLedger()` from `apps/mobile/src/db/index.ts`. It opens one persistent Expo SQLite database, applies generated migrations and returns the composed API. Failed opening/migration rejects without resetting data; a later call can retry. Always await writes and preserve form input until the promise resolves. The screen API hides raw database access and low-level import writes; infrastructure/tests can use `createLedger` separately.

| Workflow | API |
| --- | --- |
| Manual expense/income | `saveManualEntry({ id, amountInr, direction, occurredAt, categoryId?, accountId?, note? })` |
| Transaction details/feed | `getTransaction(id)`, `listTransactions({ month?, categoryId?, accountId?, direction? })` |
| Corrections/deletion | `editTransaction(id, patch)`, `softDeleteTransaction(id)` |
| Account setup | `createAccount`, `listAccounts`, `updateAccount`, `archiveAccount` |
| Category setup | `createCategory`, `listCategories`, `updateCategory`, `deleteCategory` |
| Monthly totals | `getMonthlySummary('YYYY-MM')` |
| Monthly category budgets | `setBudget`, `editBudget`, `removeBudget`, `listBudgets`, `getBudgetSummary` |
| Bills | `createBill`, `editBill`, `removeBill`, `setBillPaid`, `listBills(today)` |
| Paste review | `preparePaste(raw)`, then `saveReviewedPaste(prepared, corrections, options?)` after confirmation |
| CSV content | `exportTransactionsCsv()` |

IDs are caller-supplied and stable. Keep the same manual-entry ID during retries or simultaneous submits: a duplicate ID rejects and preserves the saved row. A new ID denotes a new entry. Validation/storage errors propagate to the screen; the data layer never clears user input or silently falls back to ephemeral storage.

Manual INR input accepts plain decimal digits, optional one/two decimal places and surrounding whitespace (`450`, `450.5`, `450.50`). Currency symbols, grouping separators, exponent notation, signs and fractional paise are rejected. Conversion uses integer arithmetic; amounts must be positive safe integer paise. Dates at transaction boundaries are valid `Date` objects. Bills use actual calendar `YYYY-MM-DD` dates; `listBills` receives today's date explicitly. Categories referenced by transactions, tombstones, budgets or child categories cannot be deleted. Budget categories must remain expense categories.

## Approved calculation rules

Month selection uses India calendar boundaries (UTC+05:30), independent of device timezone. Only posted, non-deleted records without `excludeFromStats` enter totals. Spending counts debit expenses and subtracts credit refunds/reversals in their receipt month. Income counts credit income. Transfers, cash withdrawals, pending/failed entries and other direction/kind combinations are excluded. Category budgets use exactly the same expense calculation. Empty totals are zero; no budgets returns an empty list; remaining amounts can be negative or exceed the original budget after refunds. Unsafe aggregate/remaining amounts reject instead of rounding.

These are recorded cash-flow totals, not account balances or forecasts. A paid bill does not create a transaction or change spending. Bill status is paid, otherwise overdue when its due date precedes the supplied day, otherwise upcoming (including today). Recurrence and notifications are deferred.

## Paste identity and recovery

Preparation is asynchronous and uses device-keyed HMAC-SHA256, with separate domains for key identity, body fingerprints and transaction identity. Matching UPI references/direction/status/kind share identity across alerts; otherwise identical sender/body text shares identity independently of paste time. Two genuine identical no-reference messages remain indistinguishable: record the second manually. Preparation retains candidates and keyed metadata, never the raw body. The screen owns transient raw input and clears it after completion/dismissal, without logging it.

Native secrets use Expo SecureStore; browser secrets are nonextractable WebCrypto keys in IndexedDB. The financial database remains SQLite on all platforms; IndexedDB stores only the browser key. No secret enters SQLite, CSV, telemetry or logs. Browser key protection depends on the browser profile and origin; this is not protection against malicious same-origin code or an unlocked compromised device. Crypto/store failures reject; there is no weak-hash fallback. [Expo Crypto](https://docs.expo.dev/versions/v58.0.0/sdk/crypto/), [SecureStore](https://docs.expo.dev/versions/v58.0.0/sdk/securestore/).

SQLite retains a public key identifier. If the key changes or legacy pasted rows have no identifier, preparation reports `duplicateReviewRequired: true`; save raises `DuplicateReviewRequiredError` unless the user explicitly confirms duplicate risk with `{ acknowledgeDuplicateRisk: true }`. This requirement continues for future pastes while the old marker remains. Existing rows/corrections/tombstones stay intact; the API does not pretend a new key can deduplicate against an old key. Legacy fingerprints cannot be recomputed without originals. Key recovery/portability through encrypted backup is deferred. Fresh keyed imports atomically insert or return `duplicate`; they never overwrite user corrections or resurrect tombstones.

## CSV boundary

CSV returns content only. The future export screen must obtain user initiation and handle platform destination, cancellation and write errors; it must not upload automatically. Columns in stable order: `id, amount_inr, direction, kind, status, occurred_at, category_id, category_name, account_id, account_name, source, counterparty, note`. INR values have exactly two decimal places; timestamps are UTC ISO strings. All non-deleted records are included, including failed/pending/excluded records, rather than just statistics-eligible records. Fields use double-quote escaping and CRLF record separators. Formula-like user text, including leading whitespace/control characters before `=`, `+`, `-` or `@`, receives an apostrophe prefix. Raw messages, import references, fingerprints and credentials are excluded. CSV is neither a complete restore format nor encrypted backup.

## Verification and release gates

Observed on 2026-10-07: frozen install, `pnpm check` (27 mobile/data tests and 31 parser tests), Expo dependency check, Expo Doctor (20/20), Android/iOS/web bundle exports and tracked diff whitespace checks passed. The final Node suite includes all five migrations and transaction/category integrity triggers.

A temporary fictional-data harness passed seven SQLite business/persistence checks on the connected Motorola Edge 60 Pro, including a process restart, and in browser OPFS SQLite, including reload. The browser also exercised the actual WebCrypto/IndexedDB adapter: concurrent saves deduplicated, the key persisted across reload, and deleting the generated test key required explicit duplicate-risk review. These platform observations preceded the final integrity migration/API guards; they do not establish final-revision platform validation. Isolated test databases/browser key were removed and the original app route restored. Those earlier native tests used a deterministic test signer and did not verify SecureStore/Crypto; see the final-revision follow-up below.

Final-revision follow-up on 2026-10-07: [Android build 37625072552](https://github.com/Starforge-lab/finance-bro/actions/runs/37625072552) built development client dependencies from commit `4228c54`; `adb install -r` succeeded. On the Motorola Edge 60 Pro (Android 17), the current JavaScript/native adapter passed RFC 4231 HMAC case 1 using actual Expo Crypto, all seven SQLite business checks with five migrations, concurrent keyed paste deduplication and restart persistence (process IDs changed from 29944 to 30168). Deleting only the harness-created SecureStore key and restarting produced `duplicateReviewRequired` and `DuplicateReviewRequiredError`, blocking unacknowledged saves. This uncovered and fixed Expo Crypto's native requirement for a typed-array view rather than an ArrayBuffer. Final browser OPFS SQLite also passed all seven business checks and seven reopen checks. Temporary routes/harnesses were removed; isolated databases and the owned native key were deleted, with ADB confirming no `v1-final*` database remained. Existing app data and pre-existing keys were preserved. iOS device behavior and human screen usability remain unverified.

`pnpm check` runs the SQLite-backed migration/persistence, manual validation, CRUD, totals/month boundaries, budget/bill, CSV, HMAC test-vector and import key-loss checks. `test/runtime-check.ts` supplies a reusable fictional-data scenario for native/browser storage, separate from the application's main ledger.

Native SecureStore/Crypto dependencies require a rebuilt development client. Verify the actual platform adapters and restart persistence on Android/iOS; web must verify OPFS SQLite and IndexedDB key persistence on a secure origin with required isolation headers. [Issue #34](https://github.com/Starforge-lab/finance-bro/issues/34) tracks the outstanding iOS data-layer device gate. Bundle exports and Node tests are insufficient evidence for those platform gates. Custom screens, actual CSV destinations and human usability remain separate integration gates; the APIs alone do not close their UI issues.
